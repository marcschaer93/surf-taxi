// Models:
// - Handle interactions with the database or data management.
// - Define data structure, validation, and relationships (ORM).
// - Conduct CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

// Controllers:
// - Manage the application's logic, acting as intermediaries between
// routes and models.
// - Handle and process incoming requests, perform necessary data
// manipulations, and orchestrate application flow.
// - Prepare data for views or send responses back to clients.

// Routes:
// - Define application endpoints (URLs) and HTTP request methods.
// - Map incoming requests to specific controller functions.
// - Handle the request-response cycle and middleware for validations,
// authentication, and authorization.

// What Belongs Here:
// - Models: Database interactions, data structures, validations.
// - Controllers: Application logic, request handling, data processing.
// - Routes: Endpoint definition, request handling, and mapping to controllers.

// What Doesn't Belong Here:
// - Models: Presentation logic, direct responses to HTTP requests.
// - Controllers: Database operations, direct access to the database.
// - Routes: Business logic, direct interactions with the database.
